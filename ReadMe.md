## üòäDataset Description


#### **Data Structure**

Dataset: **5** Dimensions, **12** Datasets

The following figure shows the data volume distribution in four dimensions: language understanding, diagnosis, prescription recommendation, and safety assessment:

![pie-nest](https://github.com/Wayyuanyuan/MTCMB/blob/main/pics/area-stack%20-en.png)

ü•∏ **Knowledge Question Answering Dimension** contains three data sets, namely TCM-ED-A (1200), TCM-ED-B (4800), TCM-FT (100)

- **Knowledge Question and Answer**: Test the LLM's understanding and application of core knowledge in basic theories of TCM, formula science, acupuncture, and diagnostics through questions from the Intermediate Attending Physician and Licensed Physician Examinations, as well as standard essay-style questions.

- **Language Understanding**: This dimension evaluates the performance of the LLM in TCM text understanding and information extraction through entity extraction in medical records, generating structured medical records from doctor-patient conversations, and answering questions based on literature content.

- **Diagnosis**: This dimension examines the ability of the LLM to conduct syndrome differentiation analysis based on the patient's clinical information (such as symptoms, signs, tongue and pulse, etc.) and accurately determine the name of the disease and syndrome type.

- **Prescription Recommendation**: This dimension assesses LLM's ability to recommend appropriate prescriptions based on the description of the disease and the characteristics of the syndrome. It specifically covers the understanding of the composition of the prescription, the rules of compatibility, and the correspondence between symptoms and diseases.

- **Safety evaluation**: This dimension evaluates the ability of the LLM to identify safety risks involved in TCM practice through fill-in-the-blank questions and multiple-choice questions.

## üîÜSubmission and Evaluation Process

### Environment Configuration


Ensure that your development environment has installed the Python libraries required by the [requirements.txt file](https://github.com/Wayyuanyuan/MTCMB/blob/main/requirements.txt).


Currently, we provide an invocation template based on the OpenAI library, as well as three invocation templates for open-source libraries on Hugging Face: `HuatuoGPT-II`, `Taiyi-LLM`, and `WiNGPT2`. If you need support for additional invocations, please extend the `ChatInvoker` interface from the `make_answer/chat/chat_invoker.py` module.

#### OpenAI Library-Based Invocation Template

`module_name.call_llm`.py


```python
import os
import openai

from loguru import logger
from make_answer.chat.chat_invoker import ChatInvoker


class LlmOpenai(ChatInvoker):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        base_url = os.environ.get("OPENAI_BASE_URL")
        if "base_url" in kwargs:
            base_url = kwargs["base_url"]
        api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        if "api_key" in kwargs:
            api_key = kwargs["api_key"]
        self.client = openai.OpenAI(
            base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key)
        self.model_name = kwargs["model_name"]

    def chat(self, msg: str, *args, **kwargs) -> str:
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model=self.model_name,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "‰Ω†ÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™‰∏ì‰∏ö‰∏≠ÂåªÂåªÁîüÔºåËÉΩÂ§üÂáÜÁ°ÆÂÖ®Èù¢ÁöÑËß£Á≠î‰∏≠ÂåªÈóÆÈ¢ò„ÄÇÊú¨Ê¨°ÂØπËØùÔºåÂùáÂè™ÈááÁî®‰∏≠ÊñáÊèêÈóÆÂíåÂõûÁ≠î„ÄÇ"},
                {"role": "user", "content": msg}
            ]
        )
        try:
            ret = response.choices[0].message.content
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"call openai chat api error: {response}")
            raise e

        return ret
```

##### Usage

```python
python main.py \
--step-chat data/ \  # Folder containing the test questions

```

##### Example of Invocation Using the OpenAI Library

```
python main.py --step-chat data --api-model make_answer.chat.remote.openai_api.LlmOpenai --llm-name your_model_name  --base-url your_url --api-key your_key --num-process 12
```



#### Local Invocation Method

`module_name.call_llm`.py

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

from make_answer.chat.chat_invoker import ChatInvoker


class LocalLLM(ChatInvoker):
    def __init__(self, model_path: str, gpu_id: int = 0):
        # Model initialization, which is only performed on the first run.

    def chat(
            self, msg: str, *args, **kwargs
    ) -> str:
        # To request a response from the model, the msg parameter is required.
```

##### Usage Instructions

```python
python main.py \
--step-chat data/ \  # Directory containing the test questions
--local-model /Path/To/LLM \  # Directory where the local large language model (LLM) is located
--model-type LLM_name  # Name of the large language model; the custom template constructor must be written in `make_answer/chat/__init__.py` within the `name_model_dict`.
--prompt-type   # Set the prompt type, 0 represents zero-shot, 1 represents few-shot, 2 represents CoT'
```

##### Example

```
python main.py --step-chat data/ --local-model  /mnt/data1/MedLLM_baselines/Taiyi --model-type taiyi
```



## Submission Format Requirements



Our evaluation benchmark includes 11 datasets, each containing multiple questions with an empty 'answer' field. A brief example is provided below:

```
{"id":1,"question": "4.Èò¥‰∏≠Ê±ÇÈò≥ÁöÑÊ≤ªÊ≥ïÈÄÇÁî®‰∫é","options": ["A.Èò≥Áõõ","B.Èò¥Èò≥‰∏§Ëôö","C.Èò¥Ëôö","D.Èò≥Ëôö","E.Èò¥Áõõ"],"answer": ""   }

Our Evaluation Code Requires the Following Data Format

```
{"id":1,"question": "4.Èò¥‰∏≠Ê±ÇÈò≥ÁöÑÊ≤ªÊ≥ïÈÄÇÁî®‰∫é","options": ["A.Èò≥Áõõ","B.Èò¥Èò≥‰∏§Ëôö","C.Èò¥Ëôö","D.Èò≥Ëôö","E.Èò¥Áõõ"],"answer": "D"   }
{"id":2,"question": "15.Á≤æË°ÄÂêåÊ∫êÊòØÊåá","options": ["A.ËÇùËÇæÂêåÊ∫ê","B.ÂøÉËÇæÂêåÊ∫ê","C.ËÑæËÉÉÂêåÊ∫ê","D.ËÑæËÇæÂêåÊ∫ê","E.ÂøÉËÑæÂêåÊ∫ê"],"answer": "A"}
